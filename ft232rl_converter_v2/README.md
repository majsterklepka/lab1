Hi, My Dear Friends!

Today, I have to present for You New Project. This is a simple use of the Manufacturer Application Note of FT232RL chip. Here you have a 3D View of PCB layout:

At the root tree of the project folder, you can find a file named BOM with various extensions. This is a list used in the project materials. Of course, I remember about ship to you a schematic diagram, here we have one:

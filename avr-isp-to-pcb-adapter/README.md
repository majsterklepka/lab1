# AVR ISP to PCB Adapter
electronics workshop

My proposal for today: a small dimension PCB with IDC connector, size 18mm x 23mm rounded. For what it is? If you work with microcontrollers, and contact plates, that project is dedicated for you. This is IDC to contact plates adapter. Below you can see a picture with a 3D view of full design. Project is very simple, size between connectors is equal 3 x 2.54 mm and is fully compatible with most contact plates

Schematic sheet is present below and of course, as KiCad project into this folder:

And, as you can see, PCB layout project:

Have fun with that project!

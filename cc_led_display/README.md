# Experimental CC LED Display
electronics workshop

Now, I present a simple, no! The simplest project, one difficulty is that this project requires double side PCB. You can use them for Arduino Projects, AVR Projects(for example with my Dev Board) and for what you only wish! Here is a schematic diagram:

Here You have a view of PCB in 3D, generated with Kicad 3DView:

What you need to make this project? Here is a list

- 8 x 1k resistor 0.125W
- 1 x OPD-S5621G-BW LED display with common cathode
- 1 x PCB
- solder, soldering iron, flux, side cutters, tweezers ...

I will be forgotten! I make a PCB project too! Here you have one:

Have fun! Feel free and share this project with friends! The project has two licenses: GNU GPLv3 and GNU FDL-1.3. You can use it as you wish, but please, remember about The Author!

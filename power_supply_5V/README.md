# Power supply module
electronics workshop

Hi! Here we have a module of standard (constant)voltage output +5V. Module is build with popular chip 7805 and a few discrete component. I have designed a PCB for it. At the same ideas, I will be create projects for various output voltage like +12V, +15V, -5V, -12V and symmetric (15 +15 Volts ...), etc. Below I publish a PCB layout 3D view

Project was made with use of [KiCad](http://http://kicad-pcb.org/ "KiCad an Open Source EDA Software") an Open Source EDA Software. Here we have a schematic sheet of the circuit:

And as for previous projects, I made PCB layout project:

## A few words of concepts

At everyday jobs, we use various things, making jobs in electronics, we use a lots of stuff, like powers supplies..., etc., so powered circuit needs supplies of powers in various, different parameters. Popular series linear IC, like 78\*\* make these jobs easily and faster to do ... Fabricated power supplies cost much more and have specialized IC inside, very often, that equipment is damaged and repair is too expensive to do, making such devices in your laboratory is simply cheaper and more economical and, in addition, raises and consolidates qualifications.

PCB is single side, easy to make in own workshop. Not all projects are that created, please remember this for the future! At my site too!

Be have a fun with that project and be happy!

# MicroUSB to PCB Adapter
electronics workshop

My proposal for today: a small dimension PCB with micro USB connector, size 10 mm x 16 mm rounded. For who it is? If you work with microcontrollers, USB Power Supply, and contact plates, that project is dedicated for you. This is an Adapter to contact plates. Dimensions are fully compatible with most contact plates.

## Schematic Diagram

Schematic diagram is present below and of course, as KiCad project into this folder:

## PCB Layout (2D)

And, as you can see, PCB layout project:

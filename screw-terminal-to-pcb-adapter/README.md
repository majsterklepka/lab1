# Screw Terminal to Contact Plates Adapter
electronics workshop

My proposal for today: a small dimension PCB with screw terminal and pin header connectors. For who it is? If you work with contact plates and prototypes, that project is dedicated to you. This is an Adapter to contact plates. Dimensions are fully compatible with most contact plates.

Here you have a small dimension PCB with less than three elements.
You can use it as you wish, only your mind is an obstacle that limits you.

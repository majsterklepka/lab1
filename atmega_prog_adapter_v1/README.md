# ATmega adapter
electronics workshop

Hi!

Now here I present a project of ATmega programmer adapter. For what is them? For You! Schematic is very simple, just one ZIF socket, one Kanda socket and a few discrete elements. Project was made with use of KiCad, and graphics are prepare with use of Inkscape. Below I present a Schematic Sheet:

This adapter is used for flashing following devices:

- ATmega48A
- ATmega48PA
- ATmega88A
- ATmega88PA
- ATmega168A
- ATmega168PA
- ATmega328
- ATmega328P

Of course this adapter needs to work a programmer, for example: USBasp or ArduinoISP. Below is shown 3D view of PCB Layout(without showing elements):

and here, is shown a 2d view of PCB Layout:

These all programmers, their projects are published in my repository [here](https://github.com/majsterklepka/avr-programmers.git "MajsterKlepka AVR-PROGRAMMERS Repo")

Have a fun and do not wake up the neighbors during night fun, because this occupation is very addictive and exciting! Feel free and share this project with friends!

# AC/DC symmetric supply
electronics workshop

Hi, My Friends!

Today, I present you with an ac/dc symmetric supply. This project is simply to reproduce, you can use a standard Thermo transfer method, widely described at YouTube. Below you can see a 3D view of PCB layout with components:

Here you can see a schematics sheet, it is very easy, you can reproduce it as you wish:

Of course in that folder, I have included all project files, with Gerber files too.

And here you can see a 2D view of PCB layout:

Have fun & share that project with your friends!

# LED strip with eight diodes
electronics workshop

Hi! LED strip for use in any project, inspired by the [avr-gcc](http://hobby.abxyz.bplaced.net/index.php?pid=4&cid=1 "Internetowy kurs avr-gcc") course. Below a PCB 3D view, next as description picture up.

Here we have a schematic sheet:

And what is obviously, project of PCB:

Of course, all project files are included in this folder, with Gerber picture too. Project is very easy to copy, doesn't needs dual side laminate, can be make with thermotransfer method of PCB production in home workshops laboratory.

Have a fun with that project! Be carefully of hot iron!

# ATmega adapter v3
electronics workshop

Hi, my Dear Friends! 

Here we have a next version of my ATmega adapter project. This project have exluded from main circuit quartz crystal with capacitors, which is a separate module, a sub-project. Of course, this project was created using KiCad and, like the others, is licensed under Free License (GNU GPLv3). The root directory contains Gerber files, as does the sub-project directory. Today I do not place any graphics, all the necessary information is in the documentation.

Feel free and share this project with your friends!

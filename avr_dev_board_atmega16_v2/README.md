# AVR Atmega16 Dev Board v2
electronics workshop

Hi! Here I have a proposal for you! A Development AVR Board with Atmega16A microcontrollers. This version have build in a linear power regulator +5V, here you see a 3D PCB layout view:

Schematic sheet is present below and of course, as KiCad project into this folder:

And, as you see, PCB layout project:

Of course, you can look inside drawings/ folder, you see there a PDF documents.

Have a fun with that project!

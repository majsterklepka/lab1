# Barrel Jack to Contact Plates Adapter
electronics workshop

My proposal for today: a small dimension PCB with barrel jack DC connector, size 13 mm x 27 mm rounded. For who it is? If you work with contact plates and prototypes, that project is dedicated to you. This is an Adapter to contact plates. Dimensions are fully compatible with most contact plates.

Of course, you can look inside KiCad project files too! All are in the present folder.

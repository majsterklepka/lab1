# MicroUSB to PCB Adapter
electronics workshop

My proposal for today: a small dimension PCB with micro USB connector, size 15mm x 24mm rounded. For what it is? If you work with microcontrollers, and contact plates, that project is dedicated for you. This is an Adapter to contact plates. Below you can see a picture with a 3D view of full design. Dimensions are fully compatible with most contact plates. My two proposal of design:

 
## first:

## second

Schematic sheet is present below and of course, as KiCad project into this folder:

And, as you can see, PCB layout project:
